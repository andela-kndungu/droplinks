# Droplinks

A minimal example demonstrating saving web links to Dropbox

## Getting Started

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/download) to get `npm` (the node package manager),
then use it to install the libraries required by the build process.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevgathuku/droplinks.git
cd droplinks
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, get the server up by running:

`npm start`

Now you can visit `localhost:3000` to see the demo in action.
